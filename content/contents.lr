body:

I am a postdoc with [Ad Bax](https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/) at the National Institutes of Health. I work on applying nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to biophysical questions around protein folding.

I received my PhD from UIUC, where I worked with [Chad Rienstra](http://www.scs.illinois.edu/rienstra/) and focused on magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR. There I developed computational data analysis methods and studied \\(\alpha\\)-synuclein fibrils, the leading suspect in causing Parkinson's disease.
