Summary: My Personal Profile

## About Me
### Academic history.
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Jeff Hoch at UConn health working with the NMRHub team to increase the reach of NMR by lowering the barrier-to-entry. Previously i was a post-doc Adriaan Bax at the National Institutes of Health where I worked on protein folding by pressure-jump nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I worked with Chad Rienstra developing and applying solid state NMR to structural biological questions about \alpha-synuclein, an amyloid protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

### Scientific Interests
I am interested in developing new methods to extract information from biophysical systems and in developing computational methods to make the most of new and old data.

### Personal Life
My wife Elizabeth and I have a a son, born December 2016. Elizabeth and I enjoy a long-term project we call "Around the World Cooking", researching and attempting to faithfully recreate recipes from every cuisine, existing and historical. I enjoy programming, hiking, rock collecting, retro video games, computational psychology, world building, sculpting, mixology, electronics, machining, beer brewing, carpentry, and a host of other minor distractions.
