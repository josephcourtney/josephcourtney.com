Summary: My opinions on why NMR is a useful technique.

Why do NMR? Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of if not the most commonly used spectroscopic techniques used today. NMR is used by synthetic organic chemists to determine chemical structures, check the purity of their products, and to help pick apart reaction mechanisms. However, the vast majority of the use of NMR is as a push-button experiment.
